# Natural Language Processing

### Level 1: Basic Text Preprocessing
Tokenization: Splitting text into words, sentences, or subwords.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
Stop Words Removal: Removing common words that add little value to the analysis (e.g., "the", "is", "in").


### Level 2: Intermediate Text Preprocessing
Bag of Words (BoW): Representing text by the frequency of words without considering order.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Measuring the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
Unigrams and Bigrams: Considering single words (unigrams) or pairs of consecutive words (bigrams) as features.

### Level 3: Advanced Text Preprocessing
Word Embeddings: Dense vector representations of words capturing their meanings.
Word2Vec: A popular method for creating word embeddings using neural networks.
Average Word2Vec: Averaging word vectors in a document to obtain a single vector representation.

### Text Preprocessing with Libraries
Gensim: A library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis using Word2Vec and other algorithms.
spaCy: A fast and accurate library for NLP tasks, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A library for working with human language data, offering tools for text processing.

### Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs: Neural networks designed to handle sequential data, where outputs depend on previous computations.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies and overcome the vanishing gradient problem.
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): A simplified version of LSTM with fewer parameters but similar performance.


### Advanced Model Architectures
Bidirectional LSTM: An extension of LSTM that processes data in both forward and backward directions to capture context from both sides.
Encoders and Decoders: Key components in sequence-to-sequence models, where the encoder processes input sequences and the decoder generates output sequences.
Attention Mechanism: A technique allowing models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence.

### Transformers and BERT
Transformers: A type of neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel, leading to more efficient training.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A pre-trained transformer model designed to understand the context of words in all directions, achieving state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks.


### Implementing Models with PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow
PyTorch: An open-source deep learning library known for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow, making it simple to build and train models.
TensorFlow: An open-source library for numerical computation and machine learning, widely used for both research and production.

###  Machine Learning Use Cases
Apply the above techniques and models to solve real-world problems, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, and more.
